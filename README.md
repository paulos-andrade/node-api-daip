# node-api-daip
Simple Node API Overview

This API will serve as the main backend application for the architectures we will design for the DAI "DevOps Architectures Implementation Project."

Current Status:

- Initial structure defined (config, controllers, models, scripts, tests, middlewares)
- Sequelize implemented to create the initial database
- Docker Compose set up for PostgreSQL database
- POST method implemented
- GET method is currently "hard-coded" (needs improvement)

 Next Steps:

- Implement tests
