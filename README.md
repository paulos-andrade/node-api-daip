# node-api-daip
Simple Node API Overview

This API will serve as the main backend application for the architectures we will design for the DAI "DevOps Architectures Implementation Project."

Current Status:

Initial structure defined (config, controllers, models, scripts, tests, middlewares)
Sequelize implemented to create the initial database
Docker Compose set up for PostgreSQL database
POST method implemented
GET method is currently "hard-coded" (needs improvement)
Next Steps:

Implement tests
