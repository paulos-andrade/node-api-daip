# node-api-daip
Simple Node API Overview

This API will serve as the main backend application for the architectures we will design for the DAI "DevOps Architectures Implementation Project."

Current Status:

- Initial structure defined (config, controllers, models, scripts, tests, middlewares);
- Sequelize implemented to create the initial database (dropping tables when executed);
- Docker Compose set up for PostgreSQL database;
- Endpoints for users : 
  - getAll
  - createUser
  - getById
  - 
 Next Steps:

- Implement tests.
